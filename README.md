A modular, file-bound CLI tool designed to manage student academic records through active memory and persistent local storage.

---

# System Architecture

The project utilizes a strict multi-file structure. `main.c` acts as the central router, delegating tasks to specific modules. All modules share a common data contract provided by the `student.h` header file.

# Data Flow & Memory Lifecycle

To ensure lightning-fast operations, the system limits disk I/O. Data is loaded into an active RAM array upon boot. All user operations manipulate this live memory, which is only serialized back to the hard drive when the application terminates.

# Core Features

Data Persistence: Automatically manages disk I/O, ensuring no data is lost between sessions.

Active RAM Operations: Performs fast CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) directly in memory.

Array Shifting: Systematically purges deleted entries and shifts remaining memory to maintain continuous indexing without gaps.

Modular Design: Isolated logic prevents merge conflicts and allows for clean parallel development.

# Quick Start

As compiling multi-file C projects differs between operating systems, please navigate to the `student-management-system` directory and choose the build method that matches your environment.

Unix-based systems come configured for `make`. This tool reads the provided `Makefile` to instantly compile and link the entire project.


1. **Build the system:**
Simply run this in any bash/zsh terminal:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
2. **Run the tool:**
    ```bash
    ./sms
    ```

Since Windows does not natively recognize Unix `make` commands, use the provided Batch script to compile the project seamlessly.

1. **Build the system:**
Simply double-click `build.bat` in your file explorer, or run this in PowerShell:
    ```terminal
    ./build.bat
    ```
2. **Run the tool:**
    ```terminal
    ./sms.exe
    ```
